	What does this drought mean for California?  For people, it means less water for our cities, industry and agriculture. This is serious business.
	There are 17 communities in California with fewer than 100 days of drinking water left. And, for ranchers, this drought has meant that some family ranches have had to sell some or all of their herds because they do not have the means to feed them due to the lack of forage and the high cost of hay.
	For California's fish and wildlife, the drought will be deadly. Migratory birds, which fly between South America and Canada and Alaska, have fewer and fewer wet places to stop over to rest and feed. California has lost 90% of its wetlands to development already
	- even before the drought - and now with the lack of water, it appears that the federal water project that supplies critical water to our wildlife refuges may deliver only a fraction of what is normally promised. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists are speculating that the refuges may receive less than 40% of their water supply.
	 This dramatic decrease in the water supply will force refuges to pump groundwater - that is, if they have it and if they can afford to pump it. Even then, whatever available groundwater there is - 
	 and what is, is often of very poor quality - won't be enough. And, those birds that fly over California will have even fewer places to stop along the path of their already daunting journey. The result will be decreased breeding capabilities due to lack of food and poor health, and an increase in disease and death as birds crowd together in the remnant wetlands.
